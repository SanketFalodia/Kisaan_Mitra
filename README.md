#  Kisaan Mitra

**Kisaan Mitra** is an **AI-powered, voice-first assistant** designed to help Indian farmers—especially from **Uttarakhand (Garhwal & Kumaoni regions)**—discover and understand **government agricultural schemes** in their **local languages**.

---

##  The Problem

- 🇮🇳 **70% of Indian farmers** speak Hindi or regional languages  
-  Most government scheme portals are **English-only**  
-  Finding eligible schemes requires navigating **complex forms**  
-  **Limited digital literacy** among rural farmers  

---

##  The Solution

A **voice-first, multilingual AI assistant** that:

-  Listens to farmers in their **native language** (Hindi, Garhwali, Kumaoni)
-  Understands **farmer needs & disasters**
-  Retrieves **eligible government schemes in real time**
-  Responds **naturally in the same language**

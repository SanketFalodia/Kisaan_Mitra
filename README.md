# Kisaan Mitra - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

Kisaan Mitra is a Python-based voice-first AI assistant for farmers. It recommends government schemes based on farmer queries, disaster type, age, and state. The project uses **ChromaDB** for document retrieval (RAG) and JSON-based scheme data indexing.

---

## Features

- Automatically indexes government schemes from a JSON file (`uttarakhand_schemes.json`).  
- Returns eligible schemes based on farmer query (intent, disaster, age, state).  
- Uses **ChromaDB** for efficient document retrieval.  
- No sensitive data is stored; only temporary in-memory queries are used.  
- Fully automated workflow: no manual indexing required.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd Kisaan_Mitra


Install dependencies:

pip install chromadb


Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.

Usage
Running test queries
python -m test.test_rag


The first time it runs, the script will automatically create the "schemes" collection in rag_db and index all schemes from uttarakhand_schemes.json.

Subsequent runs will query the existing collection directly.

Adding new schemes

Add new schemes to data/uttarakhand_schemes.json following the existing JSON format.

Delete rag_db/ folder if you want the new schemes to be indexed automatically on the next run of test_rag.py.

Code Overview
scheme_retriever.py

Initializes ChromaDB client.

Auto-creates "schemes" collection if missing.

Loads schemes from JSON if the collection is empty.

Provides get_eligible_schemes(intent, disaster, age, state) function for querying.

test_rag.py

Contains sample queries to test eligibility of schemes.

Prints results in a readable format.

Notes

Ensure data/uttarakhand_schemes.json exists and follows the correct schema.

This project does not store any sensitive information; all queries are temporary and local.

Works only with Python 3.10+ and ChromaDB.

Future Enhancements

Integrate voice input for queries.

Add support for other states in India.

Deploy as a web or mobile application.

Add real-time form-filling automation for government portals.
